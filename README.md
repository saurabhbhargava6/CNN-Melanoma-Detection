# CNN-Melanoma-Detection

## Abstract
The project focuses on developing an automated classification system for skin cancer, particularly melanoma, which is the most lethal form of skin cancer among over 200 variants. The diagnostic process involves clinical screening, dermoscopic analysis, and histopathological examination. Early identification is crucial, and visual examination and dermatoscopic images play a significant role, achieving an initial accuracy of 65-80%. The project aims to enhance diagnosis accuracy through image processing techniques, ultimately creating a reliable system for skin cancer classification based on skin lesion images.


## Problem Statement
In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report.
 The aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model.
 The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.

## Motivation
The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the advanced image classification technology for the well-being of the people. Computer vision has made good progress in machine learning and deep learning that are scalable across domains.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.

To overcome the issue of class imbalance, used a python package  Augmentor (https://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to add more samples across all classes so that none of the classes have very few samples.


## CNN Architecture Design
To classify skin cancer using skin lesions images. To achieve higher accuracy and results on the classification task, I have built custom CNN model.
Rescaling Layer:
To rescale an input in the [0, 255] range to be in the [0, 1] range.

- Convolutional Layer: Applies a convolution operation, converting pixels in its receptive field into a single value. This reduces image size and consolidates information.

- Pooling Layer: Reduces feature map dimensions, lowering parameters and computational load. Summarizes features in a region generated by a convolution layer.

- Dropout Layer: Randomly sets input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.

- Flatten Layer: Converts data into a 1-dimensional array, preparing it for the next layer. Connects convolutional layers to a fully-connected layer.

- Dense Layer: A deeply connected neural network layer where each neuron receives input from all neurons in its previous layer.

- Activation Function (ReLU): Rectified Linear Unit activation function, outputting input if positive, else zero. Overcomes vanishing gradient problem, enhancing learning speed and performance.
